            My Dearest,
I wrote this to ease your mind. I know you’re not ready to meet yet, but I needed to share my heart. Isn’t it wild? Out of millions, we met in ML, right here. What started as casual gaming turned into me falling for you—no idea how or why, but I grew to adore you. I miss you when you’re offline and ache to comfort you after all you’ve endured.
 
This letter is my promise: I love you too deeply to let go. Even when you tried to leave earlier, I refused—I’ll fight for us. I’ll wait forever if needed. Real love does wait.
 
I accept every part of you. Please don’t grow tired of me—I’ll keep improving for us. Yes, we argue, but let’s always fix things fast. No grudges, just us. And please take care of yourself—your well-being matters most.
 
We’re not official, but my heart is yours. I’ll never abandon you. I’ll undo my mistakes, protect you from past hurts, and love you fiercely. Even if we’re new, I hope you feel how much you mean to me.
 
You’re my always.
I love you endlessly.
